# Find a star problem <br />
A star is a person ps who is known by every other person and does not know any other p. There can only be one star in a graph. Not all graphs contain stars. <br />
Example: <br />
1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, 3 -> 1 does not contain a star because no person is known by any other person and everyone knows at least one person <br />
1 -> 2, 3 -> 2 contains a star 2 <br />
1    2->3  4->3 contains no star because no person is known by any other person <br /> 
1 -> 4 2 -> 4 3 -> 4 4 -> 1 does not contain a star. 4 is known by everyone else, but 4 also knows 1.
